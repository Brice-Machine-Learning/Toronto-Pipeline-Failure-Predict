# Pipeline Break Prediction (Los Angeles Water)

**Status:** Scaffolding initialized — modeling begins after Kaggle competition.

This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that predicts water main
break probability using real municipal infrastructure data from Los Angeles.

The project will include:

- EDA
- Feature engineering (material, age, soil, environment, diameter)
- Geospatial joins
- Predictive modeling
- Risk scoring framework
- Visualizations and reporting
