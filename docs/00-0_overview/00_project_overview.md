# 📊 Project Overview  

This project focuses on building a realistic, end-to-end analytics workflow using publicly available municipal data to examine where, when, and why water main breaks occur in Toronto. Rather than emphasizing isolated visualizations or experimental modeling, the platform prioritizes data quality, analytical structure, and stakeholder-ready insights, reflecting how infrastructure analytics are implemented in professional utility and consulting environments.

## Municipal Water Main Break Analytics & Risk Platform

This project delivers a **production-style analytics platform** for analyzing **water main break patterns** across Toronto. It integrates **Power BI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Python-based ETL pipelines** to transform raw municipal datasets into **decision-ready dashboards** that support infrastructure planning, risk assessment, and capital prioritization.

The platform is designed to reflect how utilities and engineering consultants analyze asset failures in practice — combining **historical break data**, **environmental drivers**, and **geospatial context** into a unified analytical model.

## 1️⃣ Purpose and Scope

Water main failures are **costly, disruptive, and spatially driven**. Utilities require more than static reports; they need analytics that explain **when**, **where**, and **why** failures occur in order to support operational decisions and long-term capital planning.

This project addresses that need by developing an end-to-end analytics system that supports:

- descriptive analysis of historical break trends  
- diagnostic insight into environmental and geotechnical drivers  
- geographic identification of failure hotspots  
- a foundation for future predictive risk scoring  

The objective is not a one-off dashboard, but a **maintainable, extensible analytics platform** aligned with real-world utility workflows.

## 2️⃣ What the Platform Does

The platform performs the following core functions:

- Ingests and cleans public **water main break records** from Toronto  
- Aggregates events to consistent **monthly and geographic units**  
- Enriches break data with:
  - climate indicators (rainfall, temperature, drought conditions)  
  - soil and geotechnical characteristics  
- Stores curated datasets in a **relational PostgreSQL database** optimized for analytics  
- Exposes modeled tables and materialized views to **Power BI**  
- Delivers interactive dashboards that enable:
  - trend and seasonality analysis  
  - environmental correlation analysis  
  - neighborhood-level comparisons  
  - identification of high-risk areas  

These capabilities support both **descriptive analytics** (what happened) and **diagnostic analytics** (why it happened), while establishing a clear pathway toward **predictive risk modeling**.

## 3️⃣ Design Philosophy

The platform is intentionally designed with the same principles used in professional utility and consulting analytics environments:

- **Realistic** — built on public datasets and analytical methods utilities actually rely on  
- **Modular** — ETL, data modeling, analytics, and visualization are cleanly separated  
- **Contract-driven** — schema definitions enforce consistency across pipelines, models, and BI outputs  
- **BI-first** — Power BI is treated as a core delivery product, not an afterthought  
- **Extensible** — predictive models and additional data layers can be introduced without restructuring  

This approach ensures the system remains **maintainable**, **auditable**, and **scalable** as analytical needs evolve.

## 4️⃣ Technology Stack

- **Python** — ETL pipelines, feature engineering, and modeling  
- **PostgreSQL** — analytical storage, joins, and materialized views  
- **Power BI** — semantic modeling, DAX measures, and dashboards  
- **Geospatial datasets** — soil zones, neighborhoods, and infrastructure context  

---

## 5️⃣ Why This Project Matters

Water main failures impose significant financial and service impacts on cities. Analytics platforms like this are increasingly used by utilities to:

- identify infrastructure failure hotspots  
- understand environmental stressors affecting asset performance  
- justify capital improvement programs  
- communicate risk to stakeholders and decision-makers  

This project mirrors the **scope, structure, and rigor** of analytics systems commonly delivered by engineering and data consulting teams — while remaining transparent, reproducible, and extensible.
